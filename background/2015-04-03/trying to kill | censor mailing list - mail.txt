need to do is to stop digging.

Or, if you're think you're heading the wrong direction, it's a better idea
to stop rather than keep driving and hope for the best.

Sending an email take 2m, acquiring a new skill takes 20 hours.

But either way, this isn't development content. I'm close to filtering
y'all to spam. Please don't make me do that!
