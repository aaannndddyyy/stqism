[09:34:01] <NikolaiToryzin> Also, are you really using 4chan memes again.
[09:34:47] <zetok> NikolaiToryzin: yes, I'm going to show it to him when he comes online
[09:37:19] <zetok> NikolaiToryzin: sadly, as you know I've been banned without a reason from #tox-ontopic, where I could unleash full meme power, so -dev is the only channel that I can actually use
[09:37:55] <NikolaiToryzin> #tox-ontopic?
