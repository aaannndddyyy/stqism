[13:02:51] <zetok> NikolaiToryzin: â€¦ those posts are horribly broken when it comes to formatting, etc

[13:06:32] <NikolaiToryzin> That's actually how I wanted it to be formatted.
[13:07:37] <NikolaiToryzin> I wrote it like line wrapping didn't exist
[13:10:36] <NikolaiToryzin> Quite dumb on my part though, I wrote it in a text editor without wrapping when I have a really great markdown editor installed.
[13:12:26] <NikolaiToryzin> Problem is, I tested it in gists but githubs markdown fork horribly butchers newlines so I did the formatting and line breaks entirely be hand.
[13:13:58] <zetok> -.-
