stqism
====

This repository aims to provide background for stqism's actions, so that even someone who is not well-oriented in nuances of Tox could understand the problem.

====

**To open it** in simplest and quickest way:

1. Link: https://github.com/zetok/stqism/raw/master/stqism.fodt
2. Right click → Save Link As → Save it somewhere on your disk (make sure to keep the ``.fodt`` file extension)
3. Open file with LibreOffice

====

Entry level to view and contribute is and should remain **as low as possible**.

I have chosen the OpenDocument format, which should allow contribution and accessibility to widest range of people, since opening and editing it is possible using [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org).

``.fodt`` file type, since it allows for most efficient space-wise storage and versioning using git.


Changing the format in which information is stored is possible in case where replacement would be equally or more easy and familiar to edit for any potential contributor. As of now I am not aware of anything that would be better, considering those conditions.

# Contributing

## Content

* Contributions should not contain any form of abusing language.
* Any personal details will **not** be included (some argue that IP addresses are personal info, so they should be stripped).
* Nicks are not considered personal details.
* When referring to ``NikolaiToryzin`` / ``AlexStraunoff`` / ``Second in charge of Tox`` / ``stqism`` / ``sqt`` / ``Sqt`` it is advisable to use ``stqism`` for consistency purposes.
* When including information about ``stqism``'s actions, provide:
  - information about background
  - quote of what ``stqism`` wrote (supply it in clear text, if there is need to keep it visually consistent, make a screenshot of relevant part and embed it in document below clear text (use tables for any quotes))
  - date of when and where that did happen
  - if applicable, link to the place where it did happen
  - if it is not possible to supply a link due to circumstances, include all relevant information (like IRC log) in directory ``background/_date_in_ISO-8601_/short_descriptive_name.txt`` → e.g. ``background/2015-04-01/insisting on transifex.txt`` ([ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601))
* It is highly encouraged to keep consistent formatting in which information is stored.
  - if you are not sure how to make formatting happen, *fear not*, just put it in a 3-row table like: ![table formatting](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3148759/6939854/84182e04-d868-11e4-9119-1f9e80ea63e2.png)
* If you don't have IRC logs, fret not, for they are available [here](https://gist.github.com/zetok/9057bdd27796b34dfd2a/download).


## Sending changes

If you want to send back changes you've made, you can do so in multiple ways:
* Github pull request
* Send a patch or modified document to zetok at openmailbox dot org
* other?


### Those who will decide to make pull request:
* agree to the license under which document is stored

In case where changes to the document will look *suspicious*, I will not merge them unless I will get a proper description of changes.

Including a descriptive commit message should be usually enough, and even really short commit messages should be enough, but there may be some cases where there may be some doubt whether changes are beneficial, so…

### Those who will decide to send patch / modified document through email:
* agree to the license under which document is stored
* their contribution will be anonymous, **unless they explicitly state otherwise**

In case of modified documents, I am not going to include anything that cannot be simply copypasted:
```
modified document → plain text editor to strip formatting / etc → document in repo
```
Simply, I am going to copypaste changes from the received document, rather than replacing the current document with a received one.

If you insist on sending a modified document which has needed formatting changes that would be lost due to copypasting, please include steps how to replicate that in the original document (please note that I am not a master of LibreOffice).

### Other ways of sending contributions
Contributions supplied in any other way than those listed will be treated as if sent by email.
